                    The CodeVald project stems from the fact that "even the most chaotic of codes has got a pattern or a signature for that matter".
                    The larger the system grows, the truer this fact.
                    <br/>Assumming the business requirements are strongly object oriented, CodeVald will be deemed successful if it has the tools;
                    to analyse the fundamental objects of a system,
                    to build a template and to spew out code to represent the objects and their relationships.
                    <br/>If we stay true to our ambition, CodeVald will be able to at least prototype an application.
                    With a prototype that has solid building blocks that you have designed and autogenerated, you can focus your
                    energies on finer details of the system. More time is dedicated to creativity and meeting special business requirements.
                    <br>We are a very small <a href="{% url "codevaldapp:Team" %}">team <i class="fa fa-trophy"></i></a> and would appreciate the contribution of visionary forces to foster the project.
                    <br/>CodeVald runs on Django for python. The converters are detachable python modules.
